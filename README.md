# SkitiaBG2RomanceTweaks
This mod adjusts the original BG2 romances to be a bit less harsh when you separate from a romanceable companion for a while. 
It makes the following changes to the romance experience

-Aerie, Anomen, and Viconia's romance will not end for up to fifty days after seperating from the player, a significant increase from the original time frame.

-Jaheira's romance will not break on seperation, except on two occasions. 

--One can be avoided by saying you will only seperate for a couple of days. 

--The other one is during her quest during a rather serious situation: you should let her rejoin the party, else the romance (and her life most likely) will end.
